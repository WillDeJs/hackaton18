This project is set up for the NJIT 2018 hackathon. This project aids students in managing and tracking their class progress. 

In order to run. Open the folder containing the project files on the command line and run the command 'node app.js'. 
This will create a webserver on your machine that you can access from your web browser by accessing the page 'http://localhost:3000'. 
Doing this will give you a webpage that contains our app. Originally it will show nothing but we can add code on the 'index.hmtl' file 
for the apps infrascture. 

The front end is accessed through the index.html file while the server side /backend is on the app.js file.
